🧠 PART 1: What is an API? (Super Simple Explanation)
✔ API = A messenger

API means Application Programming Interface.

Think of an API as a waiter in a hotel:

You → give a request (order food)

Waiter → goes to kitchen (server)

Kitchen → prepares food (data)

Waiter → brings food back to you

Similarly:

Your Python program → sends a request to API

API → finds the data (weather)

API → sends it back as JSON (a format like a dictionary)

🧠 PART 2: What is a Weather API?

OpenWeatherMap is a website that stores real-time weather data.

When you send:

Give me the weather of Chennai


They respond with a JSON (data format) like:

{
  "name": "Chennai",
  "main": {
    "temp": 31.5,
    "humidity": 74
  },
  "weather": [
    {"description": "clear sky"}
  ],
  "wind": {
    "speed": 3.1
  }
}


Your Python program reads this and prints:

Temperature: 31.5°C
Humidity: 74%
Condition: clear sky


That’s all!

🧠 PART 3: What is an API KEY?

Every person using OpenWeatherMap must have a unique key.

Example of an API key:

fd430b7afa94f1d0c0283b90168c65c1


This key is like a password / token that tells OpenWeather:

“This request is from Surya.”

Without the key → They won’t give weather data.

🧠 PART 4: How your Python code uses the API

Your project sends a request like this:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Chennai&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric


Parts:

q=Chennai → City

appid=YOUR_API_KEY → Your unique key

units=metric → Temperature in °C

Your Python code uses the requests library to call this URL.

🧠 PART 5: Step-by-Step — What your program does
Step 1 → Ask you: “Enter city name”

Example:

Chennai

Step 2 → Ask you: “Enter API key”

Example:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Step 3 → Program creates a URL:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Chennai&appid=xxxxxxxxx&units=metric

Step 4 → Python sends the request to internet

The API sends back JSON data.

Step 5 → Program prints the results:
Weather report for: Chennai
Temperature: 30°C
Condition: clear sky
Wind: 3.1 m/s

🧠 PART 6: How you run it (FULL STEPS)
STEP 1 — Install Python (if not installed)
STEP 2 — Install "requests"
pip install requests

STEP 3 — Save the script as Project2.py
STEP 4 — Get an API KEY from OpenWeather

Free account → free key.

Website:
https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up

After sign-up → You get a key in your dashboard.

STEP 5 — Run the app
python Project2.py


It will ask:

Enter city name:


Then:

Enter your OpenWeatherMap API key:


Done ✔
